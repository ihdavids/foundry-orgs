# Orgs, an org mode server FoundryVTT Integration Module

Orgs is a simple go based server that serves up your org mode file content
over a web socket and facilitates the manipulation of your data.
I find it convenient to design my campaigns in simple org mode files, but
find I want the content ingested into my campaign at a later date as journal
entries or other items. This module facilitates working outside of foundry
when creating your content.
